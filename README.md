# BOTBALL
2020 Robotics

A long time ago, I started developing a database for an easier way of coding. 
With this database, it's easy for students who don't even know how to code to 
create programs easily for their robots. For students that are good at coding, 
this database can also save some time of coding. I think I will upload some 
new files to this website in next few weeks.
Thanks for reading.
